Hello, I'm Yanxing Liu. I got a bachelor degree in School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, China in 2021. I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D degree in Aerospace Information Engineering and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests include few-shot object detection, remote sensing image analysis, and deep learning.

Besides research, I'm particularly interested in the composition principles of computers and robotics. I enjoy building my own robots and computers. I have broad hobbies in reading, writing, and coding.

I am expected to finish Ph.D in 2026. Therefore, Iâ€™m not actively looking for job opportunities now. But I'm interested in working with anyone who is working on the above topics. Drop me an [email](liuyanxing21@mail.ucas.edu.cn) if you want to collaborate.
